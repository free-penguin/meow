Hi all!

Happy to be here @Github! Actually I know nothing about coding, I mean, nothing literally.
But I have to work with many great professional R&Ds at work, which involved so much about coding (distributed computing/AI/machine learning etc.)
So, I think it's nessesary to learn something about coding and computing development.
And my R&D colleagues told me that 'there's so much fun in coding' and how they love Github, well, here I am!
Let's start to learing coding from zero!
